## [Class-Based Program Design (CBPD)](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510sp22/index.html) - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **CBPD** course from OSSU/NEU. It includes implementations of labs and assignments. Some of the exercises are found in the coursebook which is available on the course website.

The course is a continuation of the **Systematic Program Design** course which is featured in another repository. The focus is to use the principles of said course in an industrial language, **Java**.

External libraries (such as tester.jar) are available on the course website.
